//There is another way to access state in a component. 
//In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. 
//For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. 
//Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    const name = this.state.name;
    // Change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>{name}</h1>
        { /* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
